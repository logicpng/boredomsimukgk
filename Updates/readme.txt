NOTE: This ghost features sound effects! By default the sound effects will only play in user prompted dialogue (main chat logs, closing the ghost). For everything else (extra chat logs), there is a separate toggle.

Photosensitivity warning: This ghost can vibrate in place in short bursts!

You will be given the option to disable the aforementioned things on first launch, and enable them back if needed.

---- Aster™ Boredom Simulator ----

For once a peaceful day online, with no artifical construct-based AI visibly causing problems. Only issue is that leaves Aster, the dual module artifical construct living in one Urs Novak's laptop, with practically nothing to do. Fortunately, after an incident involving hitching a ride in Urs' smartphone, the two have agreed to set up a chat in a private chat client, Sputnik Messenger, to allow them to communicate without resorting to such measures. A conversation with your user- er, friend, can certainly help pass the time.

-- Side note:

Aster Boredom Simulator takes place before either Aster Assistant Software and Aster Terror Star can hypothetically happen, somewhere in the middle of the story still being made. 

Certain conversations technically spoil what would happen in the story up to that point. This is done in case I never manage to publish the story in full due to the geopolitical situation of where I live. The purpose of the ghost is to both be a little text based game, and show what is in mind for CaelOS so far.
